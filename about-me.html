        <h2>My name is Robert S. Kesterson. All of my friends call me Krob.</h2>
        <p>I live in Captiol Hill and enjoy studying computer science and philosophy.
          <br>
        This tends to make me extremely efficient at researching details and asking quetsions,
        but (occasionally) makes it tough to deliver on coding assignments quickly at work.
        <br>
        I have a pet cat named Randy, whom I have a great deal of respect for.</p>
